# README.md file for the FmtkTOCspotter app in the ./tocdata directory
#

NOTE: The current codebase assumes that this `tocdata` directory will be moved or copied to the user's `home` (`~`) directory. Under Windows that would be similar to `C:\Users\<user_name>\`. Under MacOS (or Linux), this would be similar to `/Users/<user_name>/`.

More information coming soon about how to contribute csv files, and optionally,
jpg image files for the TOC (Table of Contents) pages you spot as part of the
MagTOC.ml project at GitHub.
