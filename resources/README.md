# MagTOCspotter Resources Directory
The resources subdirectory contains this README file and the FormBuilder app-specific FBP file used to conveniently design and generate the UI/UX for the TOCspotter app.

Use of the FormBuilder GUI builder application is for the primary developer's convenience and is not needed to extend and contribute to this project. When used as supplied, FormBuilder will generate the pure Python file, FmtkTOCspotterGui.py, that contains the base class, FmtkTOCspotterGui, that is then subclassed to create the functional UI/UX of the TOCspotter app.

While the generated form includes a comment in the header of the file NOT to edit this file as it will be overwritten when FormBuilder generates updates of the design, we do minimally tweak it before providing as part of this repository. Our tweaks are limited to minor edits that provide PEP style formatting to the file as generated by FormBuilder.
