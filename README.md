# MagTOCspotter
This repository is for the source code of a Python-based app to crowdsource identification of magazine TOC (Table of Contents) pages of magazines in collections at the Internet Archive. The initial focus of our collaborative effort is to spot, layout segment, and eventually ground truth transcribe the TOC pages of the over 19,000 items (usually individual issues) of serial publications in the collection of collections in the [Computer Magazines Archives](https://archive.org/details/computermagazines) at the Internet Archive.
